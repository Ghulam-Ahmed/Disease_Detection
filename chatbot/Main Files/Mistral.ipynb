      "{'page_content': 'Hey Just wondering.  I am a 39 year old female, pretty smallMy heart rate is around 97 to 106 at rest, and my BP is 140/90 and twice I get 175/118I did visit a doctor because I  didnt feel well past month or twoThen the doctor gave me a heart medicine to take the pulse down and BP  (its still in further examination.)But I wondering what it can be? Do I need the medicine really?  Is that bad ?', 'answer': \"hello and thank you for using chatbot. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. we talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmhg. a person might have high value during emotional and physicals trees so it's mandatory to judge on mean values. usaly hypertension does not give any symptoms but left untreated he slowly modifies the heart. according to heart rhythm, the normal rate is between 50-100 beat for minute. when it exceeds 100 we talk about sinus tachycardia. this might have different causes to simple emotional stress, physical activity, coffee consumption or pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism. so if we diagnose hypertension and rhythm issue we have to find they cause and of course treat them. if you treat the hypertension than you have nothing to worry. if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo, a full blood analyze, a holder rhythm and pressure monitoring. this gives a better view how to treat the problem, medical or not. but as you catch values up to 170 i think medical treatment is necessary. hope i was helpful. wish you good health. best regards.\"}\n"
